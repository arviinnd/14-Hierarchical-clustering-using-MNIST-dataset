Subject: use case on hierarchical clustering using MNIST dataset <br>
<br>
Respected everyone, <br>
<br>
The given use case is based on Hierarchical clustering. We use the MNIST dataset which is a dataset for handwritten images. First 
we import the dataset and then carry out embedding in 2D using spectral embedding. We carry out the merges using different linkage 
criteria: ward linkage, average linkage and complete linkage. Then we plot the dendrogram. Then we carry out visualization of number 
of clusters by assuming distance between points as 20. N.B.: Since the model is computationally intensive, we work on a dataset of 
500 points instead of 60000 points (for practice). <br>
<br>
Thanks and regards, <br>
Yours sincerely, <br>
